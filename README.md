## DV - Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics

###  Project Overview
**Supportlytics** is a Data Visualization & Analytics project focused on analyzing IT support ticket data to uncover performance trends, optimize resolution times, and improve service efficiency.  
The project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, clustering, and visual dashboards to provide actionable insights for enhancing IT support operations.

---

##  Project Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze IT support ticket data to:

- Identify key performance trends  
- Optimize ticket resolution times  
- Enhance service efficiency through analytics and data visualization  

The goal is to uncover patterns in customer requests, technical issues, and support performance metrics to recommend improvements in workflow and resource allocation.

---

##  Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we aim to:

- Understand and preprocess IT support ticket data  
- Explore trends in ticket volume, priority, resolution time, and issue categories  
- Identify clusters of similar issues using similarity scores and clustering techniques  
- Visualize key performance metrics through dashboards and charts  
- Generate actionable insights to optimize support operations  
- Prepare a final analytical report and presentation

##  Dataset Details
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Type:** IT Support Ticket Logs  
- **Common Attributes (example):**
  - Ticket ID  
  - Ticket Type (Request / Problem / Incident)  
  - Category (Security / Integration / Bug / etc.)  
  - Priority (Low / Medium / High / Critical)  
  - Country / Region  
  - Created Date  
  - Resolution Date  
  - Similarity Score  
  - Cluster ID / Cluster Name  

---

##  Modules Implemented

### 1. Data Acquisition and Understanding
- Load and inspect IT support dataset  
- Understand column types and relationships  
- Define key metrics such as:
  - **Resolution Time**
  - **Response Efficiency**
  - **Priority Distribution**

---

### 2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Handle missing or incomplete fields  
- Create new derived columns such as:
  - `Resolution_Time = Resolution_Date - Created_Date`
- Categorize `Similarity_Level` into performance buckets  
- Encode categorical fields for clustering and analysis  

---

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze ticket types:
  - Request
  - Problem
  - Incident
- Visualizations include:
  - Ticket volume by **country** and **priority**
  - Distribution of issue categories (Integration, Security, Bug, etc.)
  - Resolution time analysis

---

### 4. Performance Insights & Optimization
- Compare resolution times across:
  - Priorities
  - Countries
  - Categories
  - Clusters
- Detect performance gaps in particular clusters/categories  
- Recommend process improvements such as:
  - Resource reallocation
  - Prioritization changes
  - Workflow optimization

---

### 5. Visualization & Dashboard Development
Dashboards and charts created using:

- **Power BI**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Plotly**


#### Visualizations include:
- Ticket distribution by category and country  
- Resolution efficiency by priority  
- Cluster performance vs similarity score  
- Geographical trends using maps  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Power BI**
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Plotly**
- **Scikit-learn** (for clustering)
  

---

##  Key Metrics Used
- Ticket Volume Trends  
- Category Distribution  
- Priority Distribution  
- Average / Median Resolution Time  
- Cluster Frequency  
- Cluster Resolution Efficiency  
- Similarity-Based Issue Patterns
