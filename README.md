#  Supportlytics – IT Support Ticket Analytics & Visualization

## Project Overview
**Supportlytics** is a Data Visualization and Analytics project focused on analyzing IT support ticket data to uncover performance trends, optimize resolution times, and improve overall service efficiency.  
The project combines **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering techniques, and interactive dashboards** to deliver actionable insights that help optimize IT support operations and resource allocation.

---

## Project Statement
The primary objective of this project is to analyze IT support ticket data in order to:

- Identify key performance trends in IT support operations  
- Optimize tickets
- Enhance service efficiency through data-driven insights  

By examining patterns in customer requests, technical issues, and support performance metrics, the project aims to recommend improvements in workflow design and resource utilization.

## Expected Outcomes
By the completion of this project, we aim to:

- Understand and preprocess IT support ticket datasets  
- Explore trends in ticket volume, priority levels, resolution times, and issue categories  
- Identify clusters of similar issues using similarity scores and clustering algorithms  
- Visualize key performance metrics through interactive dashboards and charts  
- Generate actionable insights to optimize IT support operations  
- Deliver a final analytical report and presentation summarizing findings and recommendations

- Create derived features
- Categorization of similarity scores into performance buckets  
- Encode categorical variables for clustering and advanced analysis  

---

### 3️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze different ticket types:
  - Request  
  - Problem  
  - Incident  
- Perform exploratory analysis using visualizations, including:
  - Ticket volume by priority  
  - Distribution of issue categories (Integration, Security, etc.)   

---

### 4️. Performance Insights & Optimization
- Compare resolution performance across:
  - Priority levels   
  - Issue categories  
  - Identified clusters  
- Detect performance gaps within specific categories or clusters
