DV - Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics ( Supportlytics)

Project Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze IT support ticket data to identify key performance
trends, optimize resolution times, and enhance service efficiency through data analysis and
visualization.
The goal is to uncover patterns in customer requests, technical issues, and support performance
metrics to recommend improvements in workflow and resource allocation.

Expected Outcomes
• Understand and preprocess IT support ticket data for analysis.
• Explore trends in ticket volume, priority, resolution time, and category distribution.
• Identify clusters of similar issues using similarity scores and clustering techniques.
• Visualize performance metrics through dashboards and charts.
• Derive actionable insights to optimize IT support operations.
• Summarize findings in a final analytical report and presentation.

Modules to be Implemented :-
Data Acquisition and Understanding
• Load and inspect the IT support dataset.
Dataset
Source: Internal IT Support Ticket System
• Understand column types and relationships.
• Define metrics: resolution time, response efficiency, and priority distribution.
Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
• Handle missing or incomplete fields.
• Extract new columns like Resolution_Time = Resolution Date - Date.
• Categorize Similarity_Level into performance buckets.
• Encode categorical fields for clustering and visualization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Analyze ticket types (Request, Problem, Incident).
• Visualize ticket volume by country and priority.
• Examine most common issue categories (Integration, Security, Bug, etc.).

Cluster and Similarity Analysis
• Study clusters formed using Cluster_ID and Cluster_Name.
• Measure issue similarity via Similarity_Score.
• Identify frequently occurring issue clusters and their resolution rates.
Performance Insights and Optimization
• Compare resolution times across priorities and countries.
• Detect performance gaps in certain clusters or categories.
• Recommend resource reallocation or process changes for improvement.
Visualization and Dashboard Development
• Create bar charts, heatmaps, and line charts using:
o Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or Power BI.
• Visualize:
o Ticket distribution by category and country
o Resolution efficiency by priority
o Cluster performance vs. Similarity Score
o Geographical trends using maps
